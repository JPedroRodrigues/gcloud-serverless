To deal with environment variables while using BigQuery, you should code those following commands:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<project ID>
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<credentials path>
```

> [!NOTE]
> To make those variables persist, just place these commands above in the `~/.bashrc` file.
